# chrono / calendar

Create a function called `getAgeInYears` that expects the dayOfBirth as parameter
and returns the age in year (with day precision)

## Info
The current compiler version does not include all chrono featured yet, so you have to use
the header \<date/date.h\> installed from [https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date)
